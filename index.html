                             <p> That would be me. Relax I’m not some pompous fame seeker looking to be piped into your life
                                 all hi-rez. This is just a record, and I thought you should at least know the source telling 
                                 you how it all went down. I’m no probability seer or nothing, but I’ve learned over the years
                                 to trust my gut. It’s been right more often than not and right now it’s telling me something 
                                 big is about to go down. I mean big like future generations will talk about these times. If 
                                 this city even has future generations. Before I come off like a doomsday evangelist let me
                                 just set the stage, and you can decide if this is a mad man’s ramblings or the foreword to a 
                                 cities last will and testament.</p>

                            <p> To most city state of Aranea might as well be the whole verse. From the suits staring down 
                                on their corporate fiefdoms from their neon laden ivory towers, to tweekers in the piss scented 
                                allies watching the pretty colors dance on the back of their eyelids. Every one of us spends their
                                life in the cage of concrete and wires. The truth is this cage is the only thing keeping us from 
                                getting cut to ribbons by the science projects gone feral outside the walls. Sure you can get bopped 
                                and rocked by the folk’s city side, but hey better the monster you know. </p>

                            <p>  The Central Pillar Police Department is the closest thing the common person can get to arbiters of
                                 justice. There was a time when I was much more naïve that I thought they meted out this justice in
                                  a mostly impartial way. Who would have thought a private police force would turn a blind eye when 
                                  someone who their employers deem untouchable decides they are above the law? Well a few years on 
                                  the force opened my eyes on that matter. Just not in time to keep myself from hoping out of the 
                                  frying pan and straight onto the heating element. Still they do their best to keep a semblance of
                                   peace in the city proper. Just don’t make the mistake of thinking they will take your side over 
                                   those that fund them. </p>

                        <h1>Roh Zi</h1>
                         <p> For someone that’s been exposed to the ragged depths of west district;
                         Roh Zi still manages to wear a smile brighter than the neon signs
                          littering the street outside her bar. First met the kid working 
                          the case that cost me my badge. Her old man called her in M.I.A. 
                          a few times and I noticed the higher ups didn’t seem too interested
                          in tracking her down. Only took a day, and a few squabbles with some
                          local info bros for me to track down the traffickers that snatched her 
                            for their meat puppet operation. Managed to get her out, but had to bag 
                            and tag a few bullet-stoppers. In the process one of the clients managed 
                            to get greased. Turns out he was a somebody, and my career got swept under 
                            the rug with the rest of the dirt during the cover up. Hey at least Roh Zi cuts 
                            me a break renting office space above The Jive Dive.</p>

                            <p> After ending things with the department on a low note, I had to find a way to scrape by. I ended 
                                up using the only skills I had to set myself up as a P.I. Not the most luxurious jig in town, but at
                                 least I can work on my own terms now, and make enough to keep my kibble card flush with creds. Rented
                                  some space above The Jive bar on the low after Roh Zi took it over for her pops. It’s got what passes 
                                  for class in this part of town, although the folks in Central district would laugh at what passes for
                                   fancy around these parts. The live music draws a good crowd, and the fact that most of my clients 
                                   could use a drink while telling me their woes means having a bar downstairs is handy. </p>

                                    <p> Sure the common perception about these guys is just to see them as addicts, but in 
                                        honesty they are more of a cult at this point. The tenets of these advocates of 
                                        augments are easy enough to boil down. Life sucks for humans; so replace as much of 
                                        yourself with tech until you're barely human. Cut yourself down to the lowest sum of 
                                        organic matter you can, throw it in the fanciest chassis you can scrape together, and 
                                        pop in a B.T.L. chip for good measure. Do this and you too can be the happiest tin man 
                                        on your block. That’s their claim at least...</p>

                                        don’t care about your motivations. If you make their tech look good while literally

                                         be within a city block when one breaks out. Sure they are insured but you won’t

                                        slip through the cracks, and the syndicates are there to pick them up. Anything not

                                         up for grabs and the syndicates use their numbers and network to make it theirs. 
                                         There are rumors that the most bold of them will even sell their services to one

                                     of  graffiti tags, arson debris, and hacked holo ad projectors. Simple fact is the city is
                                      growing; that is to say the population is growing. The area we are confined to however 
                                      isn’t.  So the lines are drawn. Playing the role of the parent you have the ruling Corps.
                                       Saying the risk of contamination is to dangerous to expand into the wilds, and playing the role of the tantrum 
                                       throwing child you have the Expansionist  claiming if we don’t expand we will all die from 
                                       the stagnation. I can’t really make a call on who is right, but like most I’m getting tired 
                                       of the argument that seems to only be getting more heated.</p>
