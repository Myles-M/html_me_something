                    <h1>Roh Zi</h1>
                    <p> For someone that’s been exposed to the _ of west district;
                         Roh Zi still manages to wear a smile brighter than the neon signs
                          littering the street outside her bar. First met the kid working 
                          the case that cost me my badge. Her old man called her in M.I.A. 
                          a few times and I noticed the higher ups didn’t seem too interested
                          in tracking her down. Only took a day, and a few squabbles with some
                          local info bros for me to track down the traffickers that snatched her 
                            for their meat puppet operation. Managed to get her out, but had to bag 
                            and tag a few bullet-stoppers. In the process one of the clients managed 
                            to get greased. Turns out he was a somebody, and my career got swept under 
                            the rug with the rest of the dirt during the cover up. Hey at least Roh Zi cuts 
                            me a break renting office space above The Jive Dive</p>
